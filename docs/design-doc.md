            - 
              | Number of Players | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |
              |-------------------|---|---|---|---|---|----|
              | Mission 1         | 2 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3  |
              | Mission 2         | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4  |
              | Mission 3         | 2 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4  |
              | Mission 4         | 3 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5  |
              | Mission 5         | 3 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5  |
            - All players vote (publicly) to approve or reject the proposed team.
                - If the majority of players vote for the proposed team, the game proceeds on game execution
                - If the proposed team does not get a majority vote, then the leader role rotates, the new leader propose a new team
                - If the proposals get rejected 5 times in a row, the evil team wins the mission
            - Mission Execution
                - Selected team members secretly submit either a Success or Fail card.
                - If even one Fail card appears (except Mission 4 requires 2 fail cards), the mission fails.
            - The leader rotates again and the next mission starts.
        - Victory Conditions
            - Good wins: Complete 3 successful missions.
            - Evil wins: Complete 3 failed missions or successfully identify Merlin if the good side wins the missions.
            - Merlin Assassination: If Good achieves 3 missions, Evil gets one last chance to win by guessing who is Merlin.
    - Problem statement
        - Must be physically together to play the game
        - People get distracted during the game, i.e. don't know who the nominees are or who is the leader of the round
        - It's hard to remember who voted for whom, giving people with better memories uneven advantage.
        - We need something to help us
            - tracking the game status, receive input from players then broadcast to all players
            - providing realtime status and accessible from the Internet
                - for example the current leader needs to receive notification about nominate X players for Y mission, while all other players know who the current leader is and the game is pending his/her action
            - record and list all leaders, their nominations and players votes
- Technical design
    - Actors and actions
        - Game admin
            - Creates game
            - Set game configuration
                - If the game is with Assassin
                - If the game is with Oberon
                - How many rounds of assassination the evil team gets
                - The role knowledge of each role
                  > The reason why the word soft in software is that software itself should be easily changed. This of course is the ultimate goal of all the software projects.
                    I've decided to include this because I noticed different sources give different versions of the role knowledge. Plus, it's always a good habit to make hard-coded assumptions configurable, it only takes a couple lines of code but can make your software much more flexible.

    - Considerations
        - The communication between the player and the system must be realtime and bidirectional
        - The system must be accessible via the Internet
        - In case the client side crashes or losing connection, a player must be able to restore all the data any moment, by re-joining the game or click again on the invite
    - Client side
        - Possible ways of communication
            - web page (recommended approach)
                - pros:
                    - cross-platform and device
                    - more control over how and what to present the data
                - cons
                    - need to consider browser crash and refresh
                    - less smooth interaction comparing to native app
            - email
                - pros
                    - easy to implement
                - cons
                    - delay can be high
                    - no guarantee of delivery
                    - hard to present all the data of a long game in a single email
            - text message
                - same pros and cons plus
                - cons
                    - regulation restrictions, might need verification adding too much complexity to the players
            - app

                - cons
                    - hard to develop and deploy
            - IMs app i.e. whatsapp or telegram
                - pros:
                    - free to interact with, unlike text messages
                - cons:
